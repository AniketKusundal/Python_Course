# What is PEP ?

# The PEP is an abbreviation form of Python Enterprise Proposal. Writing code with proper logic is a key factor of programming, but many other important factors can affect the code's quality. The developer's coding style makes the code much reliable, and every developer should keep in mind that Python strictly follows the way of order and format of the string.

# Adaptive a nice coding style makes the code more readable. The code becomes easy for end-user.

# PEP 8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in Python. PEP 8 describes how the developer can write beautiful code. It was officially written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The main aim of PEP is to enhance the readability and consistency of code.
