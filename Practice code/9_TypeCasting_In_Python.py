#  it means the conversion of one data type into another data type is knnows as type casting in python conversion


# a = "1"
# b = 'b'

# print(int(a) + int(b))   # int() use to conversion of string to interger
# #  it gives an error it says enter valid value






# [2]   Explicit type casting

# a = "22"
# b = "12"


# print(a + b)   # this gives the 2212 as a o/p bcoz of string concatination ("string")    ---> this is explicit type casting



# Implicit (Convesion) typecasting

# One data is coverted into onther by the python interpriter itself (automatically)

c = 1.5
d = 8

print(c + d)

#  python converts samller data type to higher to prevent the data loss
